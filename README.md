# telegram-guide-bot
This was originally supposed to be a fairly simple telegram bot, 
which allows users to find out more about the guide, trips and sign up for them.

The technologies used in this project are Camunda 8, Spring boot and the telegram-bots-api. 
The code in this project is by no means perfect, if you have any suggestions or improvements 
feel free to share them.
